"What to Test" for the next TestFlight build. `scripts/ios-testflight.sh`
sends this to App Store Connect after uploading, so it never has to be pasted
into the web form. HTML comments are stripped; only the prose is sent.

Keep it to ONE SCREEN on a phone — roughly 50 words. Testers read this in a
notification, standing up. Anything past the fold is not read, so a long note
is not a thorough note, it is a skipped one. Say what changed and what to
poke at; leave the rest to the changelog.

Rewrite it for each release. Stale notes are worse than none — they send
people testing something that already shipped.

A round of fixes from a code review. Two are worth testing directly: share a
link from Messages or Mail (not just Safari), and share an article from a site
that uses responsive images — the Guardian is a good one. Both should save with
their pictures intact. Everything else should simply feel the same, only
steadier.
